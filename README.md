# Binary-Expression-Tree

# Running Instructions:

•	This software runs on Linux 4.4.0-34-generic x86_64 (DMB 005)

•	Compile the program using the provided makefile

•	All files must be in the same folder

# Program Description:

This program accepts infix arithmetic expressions typed by the user and coverts them to either postfix or prefix notation. 

# Implementation:

The program uses a binary tree to store the arithmetic expression. The program chooses the appropriate traversal technique to convert the expression to the notation specified by the user (i.e. post-order traversal for postfix notation, and pre-order traversal for prefix notation).
